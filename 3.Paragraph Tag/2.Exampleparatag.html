    <p>Don’t be afraid of the voices, there are plenty of them here,    <!--Paragraph tag-->
        it’s the wind combing the grass
        and already for many days now
        someone’s been making love on the crushed straw
        and ragged autumn waits in the ripe maize.</p>

    <p>
        Like a bird following an executioner a cloud is following the sun,  <!--Paragraph tag-->
        the sky bleeds
        and it is beyond my strength.
        This coarse yellow that you wear in your hair
        was scattered onto the hard road from the wagons.
    </p>
